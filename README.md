### 📱 Responsive Design

Fully responsive layout that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Setup

1. Fork this repository
2. Export your collection as CSV from [Moxfield](https://www.moxfield.com/) or [ManaBox](https://www.manabox.app/)
3. Replace `data/Collection.csv` with your exported file (either `Collection.csv` or `collection.csv` works)
4. Enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from branch → `main`)
5. Your site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/mtg-collection-viewer/`

### CSV Format

The app auto-detects columns by header name, so it works with different CSV formats. Required columns:
- **Name** — Card name
- **Scryfall ID** — Scryfall UUID (required for images and data)
- **Set Code** (or `Edition Code`) — Set abbreviation
- **Set Name** (or `Edition`) — Full set name
- **Collector Number** (or `Card Number`)
- **Foil** — `true`/`false` or `normal`/`foil`/`etched`
- **Rarity** — `common`, `uncommon`, `rare`, `mythic`
- **Quantity** (or `Count`)
- **Price** (or `Purchase price`)
- **Currency** (or `Purchase price currency`) — defaults to `USD`

Both Moxfield and ManaBox CSV exports are supported out of the box.

### Changing the Admin Password

The trading binder and wishlist use a shared password for admin access (add/remove cards). The password hash is stored in `data/admin-password.json`.

To set your own password:

1. Generate a SHA-256 hash of your desired password:
   ```bash
   echo -n "your-password-here" | shasum -a 256
   ```
2. Replace the hash in `data/admin-password.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "passwordHash": "your-generated-hash-here"
   }
   ```
3. Commit and push

Or generate the hash in your browser console:
```javascript
crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', new TextEncoder().encode('your-password-here'))
  .then(buf => console.log([...new Uint8Array(buf)].map(b => b.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')).join('')));
```

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite with 250+ tests across 27 suites:

- **test/index.html** — Open in a browser to run all tests
- **test/test.js** — All test cases

Test coverage includes: game tracker, filters, deck checker wishlist integration, CSV parsing, price logic, color matching, sort order, card state management, and more.

A pre-push git hook validates all JavaScript (including inline `<script>` tags in HTML files) before allowing pushes.
